## Description
The goal of this program is to find files with sensitive information hosted on web servers, such as, for example, database backups, code repositories, configuration files, etc.

Likewise, the program will serve to display relevant information about the server and the application:
- Server version via HTTP headers 'Server' and 'X-Powered-By'
- CMS version, if you use one, through the HTML tag 'generator'
- HTTP methods enabled through the OPTIONS method
- Validity of the certificate and its information (in case the service is using HTTPS)

## Descripci√≥n adicional:
It only performs the scan from the url that is indicated to deeper directories, that is, if the url http://something.com/archives/ is sent as a parameter it does not search in external directories or on the same level, for this case example: http://algo.com/ or http://algo.com/imagenes/
