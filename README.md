## Why was this repository private?
This repository contains tools that could be used by malicious people to extract information from servers or to affect their availability. That is why I have decided to keep it out of the reach of those who do not have my authorization.

## Why is it public now?
I came to realise that information, whether can be used for malicious porpouses or not, should be public because ignorance is the real danger.
